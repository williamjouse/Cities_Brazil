# Understanding Cities and Federative Units of Brazil

This project is proposed to do an analysis of how the population is spread all around the federative units of Brazil.

We combine the data from [mapaslivres](https://github.com/mapaslivres) and another coming out of web scraping of 
[wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lista_de_munic%C3%ADpios_brasileiros_por_%C3%A1rea_decrescente). In following
we explore the data and plot some graphs.
